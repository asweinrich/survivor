bianca 
A 33-year-old PR consultant from New Jersey, Bianca has spent her career convincing top companies and journalists. Now, she’ll try to sell her social game to the other castaways. A Survivor fan since childhood, she’s studied and admired winners like Maryanne and Michele, hoping to blend charm, strategy, and adaptability. Bold and enthusiastic, Bianca thrives in high-pressure environments and knows how to manage perception. With a background in crafting narratives, she’s slated to excel at spinning situations in her favor. If she can mask her strategic savvy behind a warm and disarming presence, she could be a key alliance player and a dangerous late-game contender.

cedrik
A 45-year-old surgeon from South Carolina, Cedrick has spent years making life-or-death decisions under pressure. Now he’ll put that precision to the test in Survivor. A fan since 2000, he admires Earl Cole’s quiet confidence and Cirie’s social mastery, aiming to blend both in Season 48. Describing himself as dependable and determined, Cedrick thrives on discipline but must ensure his methodical nature doesn’t make him too rigid. With his mix of strategic thinking and emotional intelligence, he has the tools to go deep... if he can navigate the game’s unpredictable twists.
